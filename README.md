# Colorful Sections

This is a simple webpage layout with colorful sections and buttons to change the background colors of the sections dynamically.

## Description

The "Colorful Sections" webpage consists of four main sections: Heading, Main, Main Content, and Footer. Each section is enclosed in a `<div>` element and has a solid border. The heading of each section is displayed using `<h1>` tags.

The webpage also includes two buttons: "Previous" and "Next". Clicking these buttons will cycle through a predefined set of colors and change the background color of each section accordingly.

## Usage

To use this webpage, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. You will see the four sections with their default background colors. Clicking the "Previous" button will change the background colors of the sections to the previous color in the color sequence. Clicking the "Next" button will change the background colors to the next color in the sequence.

Feel free to modify the HTML code to add your own content or customize the styling as per your requirements.
